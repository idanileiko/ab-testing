## A/B Testing Tools

### Sample sizing and experiment result calculator 

Made using Streamlit and available here: https://ab-testing-calculator.streamlit.app/

Features:
- sample sizing for your experiment (how many users do I need for my test?)
- results calculation (was my experiment successful?) for discrete/binary metrics (e.g. did a user login?)

Future features:
- continuous metrics (e.g. total money spent, number of actions taken etc.) rather than binary ones
- Bayesian A/B testing with Bayes factors rather than frequentist
